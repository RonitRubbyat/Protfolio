writing is not my hobby since the beginning of my childhood. But somehow, I don't know how I found interest in writing short stories. I use to be a lazy guy so never wanted to type so long texts. But one day one of my friends named Fatema(One of my best friends) said me to start writing. She influenced me to make a kick-off. To do what I can do. So I started to type poems first. Then I write a story, then another story, and now I came to a position where I can write whenever I want. Note: Besides Fatema, there are many of my friends and cousins who also inspired me to do so. I can't mention all of their names here. But yeah! want to thank them to encourage me.
