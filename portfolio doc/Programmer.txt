My journey of being a developer is not an old story. I get interested in programming when I was in inter first year. At that time for the first time, I get introduced to a programing language. The first language I ever meet was HTML. I always wanted to build software by myself. But I never get to know about programming languages before. But look at me now, I'm building my own website. I'm super excited!
