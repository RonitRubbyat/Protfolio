                <p>
                    writing is not my hobby since the beginning of my childhood. But somehow, I don't know how I found interest in writing short stories. I use to be a lazy guy so never wanted to type so long texts. But one day one of my friends named <span class="name-color fatema">Fatema(One of my best friends)</span> said me to start writing. She influenced me to make a kick-off. To do what I can do. So I started to type poems first. Then I write a story, then another story, and now I came to a position where I can write whenever I want.
                </p>
                <p class="note">
                    Note: Besides Fatema, there are many of my friends and cousins who also inspired me to do so. I can't mention all of their names here. But yeah! want to thank them to encourage me.

                        My journey of being a developer is not an old story. I get interested in programming when I was in inter first year. At that time for the first time, I get introduced to a programing language. The first language I ever meet was HTML. I always wanted to build software by myself. But I never get to know about programming languages before. But look at me now, I'm building my own website. I'm super excited!
