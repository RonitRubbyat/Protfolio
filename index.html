            <h3>Hey I'm Ronit, A Small Writer.</h3>
            <p>writting is not my hobby from the beggining of my childhood. But somehow, I don't know how, I found
                intrest
                in writting short stories. I use tobe a lazy guy so never want to type so long texts. But one day one of
                my
                friend named <span class="name-color">Fatema(One of mybest friend)</span> said me to start writting. She
                    influnced me to make kick off. To dowhat I can do. So I started typingmy pome's at first. Then I
                    write a
                    story, then another story. And now I come to a position when I can write whenever I want to. <span
                        class="note">Note: Besid Fatema there are many of my frinds and cousins who also inspired me to do
                        so. I
                        can't write names all of them. But yeah! want to thank them to incourage me.</span></p>
